# PyBer Final Analysis

The breakdown of fares by city types (rural, suburban, and urban) correlates how the averages of fares per ride and driver represent each market. The averages increase as you move away from urban cities, next is suburban and then rural. Could be a reflection of the longer distances one may need to travel in rural communities. 

Urban drivers show a lower than average fare per driver than average ride fare, which could indicate more drivers than the market currently needs and a deeper dive into a per driver analysis might be warranted, such as peak time of use vs how many drivers are needed or active. 

Average per driver is highest in rural areas by nearly 3.5 times to urban and might be an area to incentivize people to use Pyber more. Although, suburban areas have the best balance of higher average fares and lowest total rides. By doubling suburban area use you would nearly have the same total fares as urban but this would occur with fewer drivers and fewer rides than urban areas.
